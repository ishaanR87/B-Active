# B-Active
This is the repository for my final year project, B-Active. This application will be associated as a fitness application which will provide the user with multiple features in order to encourage physical activity. The application will be developed on Android Studio Code and will allow users to track-calories, time their workouts, create workouts, count their steps etc. 

## How to Use:
This application will only be able to run on Android Studio. Once installed, open the project and test using either an emulator or a connected Android device. Press the **green** run button to run the app.
